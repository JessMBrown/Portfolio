### clone-the-repository:

Feel free to clone this project and see how I set it all up, this was my very first project on my path into tech.\
To achieve this I took part in the 
🩷**Code First Girls**🩷 SQL kickstarter course, its free to sign up for and the mountain of experience I gained it was well worth the wait for a space on this amazing free course!

My Happy docs project recieved 🩷**Best in Class**🩷 an achievement I am very proud of especially as this is my very first exsposure to tech.

<a name="Database Setup"></a>
### Database Setup:

<img src="pictures/setup.webp" alt="setup GIF" align="left" width="300" height="250" style="margin-right: 10px;">
- Create the database first
- Use the database
- Create each table in the order they are setup in the create_tables.sql
- The go into the inserts_tables.sql and run these again in the order they have been shown in the file.
- My advanced features include a trigger(locating dead patients on file and removing them from database), if you would like to use this trigger it woruld need to be run prior to the insert into tables.
If run after the insert into file it does duplicate data so please keep this in mind.
- In advanced features you will find functions, procedures, triggers, scheduler, view and finally a group by to get information from multiple tables in one search.

### Final words:

I thoroughly enjoyed this project and am happy with what I have achieved as a first time introduction into tech and into SQL.

I hope in the future to combine this project with future projects to showcase my skills across multiple coding languages and broaden my knowledge further to use the work I have put into this database to support a larger project once my tech experience has developed further.
